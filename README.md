This is a project to learn/practice how to pull data from multiple sources, process them with pandas, upload to a PostgreSQL database, and create a data visualization.

I'm curious how many games on Steam have DRM-free equivalents. This includes DRM-free on Steam itself (does not Steam client to run) and other
platforms (GOG.com, physical media, etc.).

Looking forward to having fun learning about this as I go.
